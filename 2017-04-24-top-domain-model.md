It looks like a new series is going to be published on this blog!

I received some feedback related to the recent series [making your event sourcing functional](https://blog.scooletz.com/category/event-sourcing/). Posts in this series will be loosely coupled and more-less self-contained. The topic that will connect them is modelling your domain, aggregates, processes towards models that are useful, not necessarily correct. We'll go through different domains & different requirements and we'll try to focus not on the created model (it's just an exercise) but rather on the modelling approaches and practices.

Put on your modeller's gloves and safety glasses. It's about time to crunch a few domains!
