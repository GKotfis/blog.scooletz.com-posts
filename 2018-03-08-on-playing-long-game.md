So you heard that this company used this awesome tool and was able to ship their product in 3 months? So you heard that this book helped somebody to optimize their time spent on X in some way? So you heard that he/she dropped 10kg in one month?

With every success story comes a peril. It's easy to celebrate a success. It's even easier to celebrate it if you don't mention some of the dimensions you were optimizing for.

A fast shipping company could be a software house not caring about the maintainability of their product. Ship fast, ship cheap, earn fast. That's the background of the story.

The time optimization could be measured for 1 month. What about the following 5? Could this be maintained? Maybe the book was about drinking more coffee and *doing more*?

Dropping 10kg in a month is not a problem. You can just starve yourself. What about following months? Are they ok? Can you maintain it?

Every single time you hear these awesome news, this miraculous solution to the problem, ask yourself what kind of game is it. A long game or a short one? With this, act accordingly.
