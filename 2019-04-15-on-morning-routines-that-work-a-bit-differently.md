This is an updated version of [On morning routines that work](http://blog.scooletz.com/2018/03/29/on-morning-routines-that-work/). One could say, another year, another change. And you bet, a lot of things have changed in my life.

My current morning ritual consists of:

1. mindful meditation
1. expressing gratitude (3 people/things/situations)
1. reviewing my calendar (I noticed forgetting things in there and not preparing enough, to address it, I review it in the morning)
1. reading a book
1. rolling muscles, using a roller

I tried *power poses* but after reading that they do not improve you body in the way they had been described before, I stopped doing it.

A few remarks:

* I'm considering testing something else in place of gratitude.
* I stopped exercising on specific days. My schedule sometimes is crazy. I have a plan that covers 4 workouts a week and I'm catching up with it if I'm late. This worked even when I was sick for 2 weeks. I caught up with every single one.
* After reading about sleep (as always, you can see what I'm reading on [my GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/Scooletz)), I sleep 1h more.
