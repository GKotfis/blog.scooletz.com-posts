You're familiar with [The expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg) for sure. It's popular across all developers. Many of my colleagues find it funny to watch the misunderstanding between an illogical business and a logical developer. There is a real drama hiding in the dark corners of this short. The expert's drama being sold by its own manager/leader as a universal toolish expert who will deliver. If a manager/leader needs a yes-man, it's easy to get one. They are cheap. But if one insists that a person skilled in a technical direction, with some intellect on the board will ok or yes everything which is on the table, that's a serious misunderstanding. The expert have the following choices:

1. say no which results in being persecuted
1. say yes and live with this dissonance
1. resign

If you ever be in the expert position from the movie, I advise the third option. I made the wrong choice a few years ago and this short brought back some memories.
