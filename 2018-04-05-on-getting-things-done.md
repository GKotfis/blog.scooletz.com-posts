It's the 6th month of me using one of the tasks management tools. I must say, that even if I raised several cases how the tool could be improved, the methodology of putting things in the inbox, grooming them and then executing already proved itself. Sure, from time to time a ball is being dropped, but it's so much better than it was in the past. Let me share how I approach it.

### Inbox

I use an inbox. Sometimes it's easier to put a task in there rather than think where it belongs. These will be clarified later.

### Projects

Different projects for different parts of my activities. There's a "Life" project (I hope that this one will last for some time), which covers my personal things. There's a "House" project that holds all the items that should be done in-da-house. There are different initiatives, like [DotNetos](https://dotnetos.org/), that are projects on their own. There's a list of movies to watch and a list of presentations/courses to take. For books, I use my trustworthy [goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64617109-szymon-kulec).

### On grooming and setting dates

I try not to spend a lot of time on selecting things to do. My preferred approach is to put a date on it (if I know it). On a given day, it will magically appear in my things that need to be done. Once a week I review the lists and select what to do next. Sometimes, because of setting dates, there's not that much to do - things are assigned for the forthcoming day/week.

### Burning tasks

Of course there are still task that are not closed fast enough. I spent over 30 years of my life practicing getting things done without this system, so the change won't happen in one day :) Still, the fact that number of dropped balls is getting lower and lower (with the new approach, they are not forgotten, but sometimes might be dragging).

### Tooling

It looks that there's no perfect tool for my needs and every single one requires some bending. I might consider writing an extension to the public API, if I truly need it, but for sure, I won't be spending time on trying "all these other apps".

### Future

The future is bright :) I'm doing more, I'm forgetting less and there's a still room for some improvement! Let me just check the tasks for today... Oh yes, there's one about improving the process itself ;-)
