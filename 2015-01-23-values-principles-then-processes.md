The presentation of Pawel Brodzinski published on Infoq [here](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/mindset-context-methods) is a must see. Whether you're into Kanban or not, it shows a few simple cases and discusses the three important aspects of a company:

1. values
1. principles
1. processes

and interactions between them. Additionally, some problems with visualizations are shown. One can show you all of his/her processes but is it possible to steal this know-how?
