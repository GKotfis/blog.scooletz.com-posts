How many times you heard or read "Don't reinvent the wheel"? And I don't mean a specific feedback built on data, but a general statement. It might have resonated with you as almost everyone is prone to listen to stories, proverbs and other cultural mantras.

At the same time we do see that reinventing things happen and sometimes makes the real difference. Just imagine F1 car using regular tiers, or you using a cable to access internet every single time. You may say that WiFi is not cable, it's something else. You may say that F1 tires are not the same, it's something else. And that is a true statement. At the same time, in some cases, people asked the question how things can be changed, improved or reimplemented. At the same time, one might have considered it reinventing the proverbial wheel. At the end though the new wheel may become the new incomparable thing. And then the sticky proverb no longer holds true.

Think, analyze and don't fall for a proverbial wheel of donts.
