Have you ever been in a situation when you've got not enough tooling in your preferred environment? What did you do back then? Did you use already known tools or search for something better?
Recently I've been involved in a project which truly pushed me out of my comfort zone. I like .NET, but there's not enough tooling to provide a highly scalable, performant, failure resistant environment. We moved to Java, Storm, Cassandra, Zookeeper - JVM all over the place. It wasn't easy, but it was interesting and eye opening. Having so many libraries focused on resolving specified concerns instead of the .NET framework-oriented paradigm was very refreshing.
Was it worth it? Yes. Was it good for self-development? Yes. Will I reach for every new library/language? For sure no. The most important thing which I've learned so far, was that being adaptable and aware of tools is the most important thing. Mistakes were made, that for sure, but the overall solution is growing in a right direction.
After all, it's survival of the fittest, isn't it?
