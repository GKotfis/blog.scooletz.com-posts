Sometimes it's good to take a break and give some ideas a while to regenerate in your head. After a few weeks of not touching [Themis](http://themis.codeplex.com/) at all, I wrote a lot of documentation yesterday (and a few paragraphs today). I also recompiled it with the newest build of NHibernate, to allow you using with the newest fluent NHibernate. One more news is that Themis will be used in a production project. So far it brings profits but I'm ready to immerse into it if there any optimization/extension/refactorization will be needed.

Happy Themissing!
