I've just finished the Azure workshop. In two days course you cannot get everything, but as far as I know, the discussed topics can show what Azure is all about. I won't rewrite plenty of blog entries and articles. What I want is to write that the cloud is the future. By the cloud I do not mean Azure, I mean the paradigm allowing you to scale as hell, to manage you site performance on the very organic level ("too much sugar - more insulin"). There is only one danger I can imagine and it's not the security of your data. Imagine a situation that having such a scaling environment one can improve performance of his application with scaling rather then finding a bug running a 100 additional queries in each request. I hope that programmers' culture will evolve and will disallow such behavior.
