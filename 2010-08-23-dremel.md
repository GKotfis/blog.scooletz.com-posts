I've just finished reading [Dremel whitepaper](http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf "Dremel whitepaper"). It seems that Google one more time brought to life something, which may change the IT world. Imagine queries running against trillions of rows and returning results in a few seconds, imagine fault tolerant db, that scales linear and still, allows you to query it in a very advanced ways (for instance, using grouping). Yeah, I'm aware of [VoltDB](http://voltdb.com/ "Volt DB") but the Dremel's description was just astonishing.

On the other hand: have you ever had a possibility to test your scalable app on 2900 servers? :)
