The reality of project management is simple. A project manager has a project he/she's responsible for. The project can span across multiple teams, areas, resources, whatever you want to call them (just use the name *managish* enough). The responsibility of the manager is to deliver the project, in majority of cases within the given budget (manhours). [The mythical man-month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) rule can be applied to deliver it faster by simply throwing more resources...

On the other hand, one may take a look at the teams and products. There's one thing about team and product - they are bound and it's quite interesting to see the cross-functional team delivering the whole product experience and simply being happy because of the created product. It's a natural thing to be happy because of your own creation. We all know it: build the house, etc...

And here goes Kramers! Pulling the team from one to another, arguing about behavior only from his/her project point of view, trying to match the high-level goals and estimates and discussing who paid for the ice cream, I meant, who is responsible for providing time to learn a new technology or fixing this or that.

Kramers may think that they just fulfill some orders, or that they've been given some kind of a power over others, but the question which everyone should answer is how is Billy.
