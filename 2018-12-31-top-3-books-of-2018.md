It looks like 2018 was a really interesting year. One of the goals that I was able to achieve was reading **at least 20 books**. According to [my GoodReads summary](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/64617109) I **read 34** which is not that bad, is it? I wanted to share with you top 3 books I read this year. As I write a short review for every single one I read, I'm sharing these links underneath.

1. *Principles: Life and Work by Ray Dalio* and [my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254565243)

    An amazing approach to work&life provided by the CEO of one of the leading hedge funds.

1. *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari* and [my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2210725483)

    An interesting journey through our history. A lot of interesting data in there.

1. *The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by Brad Stone* and [my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2231156457)

    Lots and lots of facts from the history of Jeff and Amazon itself.

I wish you a lot of free time in 2019 to read a lot of good books. Hopefully, at least one of the three above will be on your list.
