**TL;DR**

Recently I've been hit by my laptop failure. I use it mostly for work related programming but it's my general computer as well. It took me 2 hours to go back to fully functional state with an older but still powerful desktop. It's not that bad, is it.

### Too long

The main idea behind me being able to go on are services that I/my company use. And I don't mean some fancy backup plans. That would take much more time. I mean services like:

* GitHub (for your code),
* a password manager,
* a synchronized profile in my browser (I still tend to use a separate profile for my work and a separate for private purposes)
* a browser enabled communicator like Slack
* a browser enabled video call app like Zoom

The major part of the mentioned 2 hours was spent on installing VS 2015 + Resharper (I have a really terrible WiFi card in my PC). That would be all.

Now, it's time for you to answer the following question: how fast as an employee and as a private person can you be back after a hardware failure?
