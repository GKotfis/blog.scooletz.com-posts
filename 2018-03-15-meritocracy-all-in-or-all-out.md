There are books that are powerful. One of them is for sure [Principles of Ray Dalio](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254565243).

One of the most interesting ideas presented in this book was the meritocratic approach to decision making. Using a weighted voting and gather these data over and over again to improve the whole system. Noticing and measuring. Doing it over and over again. The interesting thing was an ability to veto any decision made by this system. Even more interesting thing was, the fact that this ability (as author claims) was not used any single time. I think it's so true to the core of meritocracy. Imagine vetoing or changing one decision and then another one and then another one. How would it support the proposed approached? Once you play this veto card, it's all out. It's either all-in or all-out. There's no middle ground.
