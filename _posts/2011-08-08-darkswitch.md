Recently I found an [article](http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/08/LightSwitch) on my RSS InfoQ feed. I do understand that InfoQ presented a new information about some programming product, but it *should* be posted with a big exclamation "Do not use it for your app". It's nothing more than another 'create app with no programming skills' product. Take a look at the [Ayende's post](http://ayende.com/blog/4575/lightswitch-the-return-of-the-secretary) or download it. I found it nothing more than a [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/) which tries to do sth more than being a simple sketch. If you want to sketch your solution, to show your devs how sth should be done - stay with Balsamiq.
