### TL;DR

This post sums up my work on [SewingMachine](https://github.com/Scooletz/SewingMachine) and introduces the new project, based on Service Fabric called [Lockstitch](https://github.com/Lockstitch/Lockstitch).

### Whys, reasoning and more

Due to various reasons including some NDA stuff that I cannot share and after lots of thinking about the way I could push Sewing Machine further, it looks that this project won't receive much more attention from me. Just to get it clear, this is not related to any "I don't have time for OSS now" or "omg, nobody likes my project". It's simple calculations followed by a few discussions about directions where this project could head.

The nature hates vacuum and at the same time when claiming that SewingMachine is almost dead, I want to bring [Lockstitch](https://github.com/Lockstitch/Lockstitch) to the table. It's again about Service Fabric, it's again about performance, it's again about distributed systems done right. Only better and on a different level. Lockstitch is aiming to work with the lowest fabric component, called replicator. The overall goals, as I mentioned are the same.

If you want to see the where is it heading, [a list of issues](https://github.com/Lockstitch/Lockstitch/issues) should provide you all the needed information.

It's important to mention [Tomasz Masternak](https://twitter.com/Masternak), who is a co-author of Lockstitch.

### Summary

Good ideas, don't die, they reappear in a different shape. This is why Lockstitch could be treated as SewingMachine++.
