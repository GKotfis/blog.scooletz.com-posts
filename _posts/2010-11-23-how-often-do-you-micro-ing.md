I did read about, I tried to used it, but the last InfoQ presentation about [Microformats](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/RDFa-Microformats "Microformats") was simply astonishing. I do not like the Scott Davis' style of presenting things, but it made me think... and the list of the biggest sites using microformats... Come on! It seems, that having your page highly ranked and being often found requires you to use it! Looking through the codeplex projects I've found a few analyzers but no extensions for ASP.MVC helping you to build a well-defined, full of micros site. What a shame ;-)
