In the [Ryan King's presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/NoSQL-at-Twitter-by-Ryan-King) you can find a plenty of good/best practices of Twitter teams. You can find tips how they use Cassandra, what kind of an awesome id generator they provide (and it is an open source: [Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/)). I do read about open sourcing as a way of getting your apps better, but I do not know where are the boundaries of showing what you've got vs. giving everyone the omnipotent 'How to steal my users and dethrone me' book. Can everything may become public? What are the root secrets you should not reveal? Any thoughts?

BTW the whole presentation can empower you in using no-sql. It's a must-see.
