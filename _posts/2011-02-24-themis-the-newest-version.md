I've just published the newest version of my authorization tool called [Themis](http://themis.codeplex.com/). I added a few things which I'll describe in the next posts. There are no breaking changes, but some of them may ease your authorization scenarios a bit. Meanwhile, I'm finishing the work on the *NHibernate.IInterceptor* example.
