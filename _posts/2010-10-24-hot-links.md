This week brought a lot of good posts:

* an interesting post from [Ayende](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/10/22/you-saved-5-cents-and-your-code-is-not-readable.aspx "http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/10/22/you-saved-5-cents-and-your-code-is-not-readable.aspx"), which estimated costs of good/bad design. It's worth mentioning that this post generated 10k visits on the original post, which Ayende commented. Maybe he should start a new kind-of-SEO company ;-)
* an astonishing news from [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/WCF-REST "http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/WCF-REST") about more http-bounded WCF. I'm looking forward to seeing it

* finally, for cat lovers who I am not, [The Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/kitty_pet "http://theoatmeal.com/comics/kitty_pet")
