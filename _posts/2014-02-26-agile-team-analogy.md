Yesterday I've had a discussion about ability to introduce a Scrum-based development in a big organization. There was a question raised whether it's possible to construct a cross-functional team and deliver shippable product with no busy waits, no "I need this from that guy" syndrome.
I thought about each team member as a team part, consuming some input (mails, requests, discussions) and producing some output. Nowadays it's much more possible to make it asynchronous, to remove all the meetings, long-running discussions, to review code of your colleagues in a post-commit manner. Having that said, you can look at each person in producer-consumer manner and the graph of the dependencies is the bus shifting the artifacts you create. What it takes to create a good team is to couple all the people which can be waiting for the output of others and collocate them in one team. The obvious producers (with much less input) would be product owners, hence, they'd be feed by testers for sure. If you have some kind of core system in your company, a guy working with it would be a perfect fit as well. Just try to collocate all the people with transitive producer-consumer dependencies. Choose the most critical and time consuming ones. Just make a bubble with a minimum input, possibly asynchronous. What about output? That would be, according to your definition of done, your shippable product. Nothing more nothing less. That's what all Agile is all about, isn't it?
