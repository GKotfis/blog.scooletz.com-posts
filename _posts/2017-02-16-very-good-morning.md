### TL;DR

This is one more personal post after my latest description of my [learning pattern](http://blog.scooletz.com/2017/02/13/my-learning-pattern/). I'd like to share how I start my morning and how it improved my overall quality of whole day.

### Morning schedule

* 5:45 AM - it's time to get up and prepare and eat the oatmeal: oat flakes, a few raisins and hot water
* 6:00 AM - by this time I've got my breakfast eaten and it's reading time!
* 7:00 AM - workout time (some weights or a stationary bike)
* 7:50 AM - post workout shake
* 7:55 AM - shower
* 8:10 AM - I'm starting to waking up my child. It takes up to 15 minutes of playing music (sometimes singing is included)
* 8:40 AM - ready for the kindergarten!
* 9:00 AM - my second breakfast
* 9:30 AM - with a cup of coffee I'm starting my work

I've been changing this schedule a little bit for 5 months now. The current version might be a subject to change, but the overall shape won't change. Why?

### Why so early?

I've always been an early bird, but a few months ago I noticed loosing focus. Keeping a morning like this, introduces some good routine/regime to my life and lets me maintain focus for my whole work day. Waking early means going to bed ~10-11PM, but occasionally I stay awake till the midnight (once in a while). Additionally, before I start my work, I got my workout, some reading, two breakfastsÂ checked. This is a really good start!

### Summary

Is this a way to go for everyone? Probably not. On the other hand, living in a world of interruptions and notifications does not improve our ability to focus. Having a morning like this - definitely does.
