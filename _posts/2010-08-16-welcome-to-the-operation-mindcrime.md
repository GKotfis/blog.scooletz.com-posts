The very first post, the very first blog. I hope all of you will find it interesting and enjoying. The main topic, at least for a few months, will be my open source project: [Deiphobus](http://deiphobus.codeplex.com/ "Deiphobus"), a .NET client for Cassandra database, providing a nice abstraction layer with features such as: batching, inverted indexes and many more!

Let the show begin!
