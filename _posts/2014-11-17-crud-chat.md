*A: Hello, have you CREATEd a new car?
B: No! I just UPDATEd its Owner field, setting it to my id. I needed to UPDATE the balance field of my Account row as well.
A: Oh, I see. Yesterday Tom DELETEd a few employees. They were stealing money. Unfortunately there is a transition period, so first he needed to UPDATE their IsActive to false, then after the period he could finally DELETE them.
B. Yes, that's the way you do it.*

No it's not. People do not use only four verbs to describe their activities, and if they do, they have a real problem. The scope of vocabulary used by business as well as other people is much wider and their is a reason behind it. You can name everything a THING, you can use only four CRUD verbs to describe activities but instead of meaningful phrases you get a long sentences filled with clarifications. Using a vocabulary consisting of a few words only will not only increase the number of words to describe something but for sure will for sure loose some of the meaning. Can you afford? Can your company afford it as well?
