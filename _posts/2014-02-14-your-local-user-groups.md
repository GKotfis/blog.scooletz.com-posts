Recently I've been deeply involved in [Warsaw .NET User Group](http://www.wg.net.pl). What makes you a deeply involved you ask? I'd say that resolving current problems would be the answer that fits the most. We covered a few important points like getting some sponsorship, being given a few tickets for [Build Stuff](http://www.buildstuff.lt/) conference (thanks!) and running snacks sessions (short presentations, for those who want to start with their presentations). It looks like people are a bit more energized and active. That's for sure the right direction for any user group.
I want to encourage all of you, just make a small move, do sth for the community you're chosen "to be involved with", for instance ask for a problem to be resolved. It's a win-win "by people, for people", nothing more, nothing less.
