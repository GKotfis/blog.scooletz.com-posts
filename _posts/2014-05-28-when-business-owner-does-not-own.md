One of the most worrying scenarios for having a business owner is a business owner who does not care. This may manifest in various ways:

* a delay in communication - you receive responses for your emails after days, weeks, when the context is already gone
* a pressure (even positive) to deliver varying over time
* a knowledge about project has to be refreshed, the basic use cases are being forgotten

The result is a semi-finished, almost-released product. Even if a team delivering the product cares, having no business verification of their ideas may ruin the project. This state may be a result of personal reasons, like not caring at all. More possible this situation is rooted at organizational issues, which result in switching long-/midterms without pushing down the reasons behind the decisions, keeping people in the zone of unknown. Despite the reason, doing a job with value deprecating in time, without final DONE isn't good for your team morale. That's for sure.
