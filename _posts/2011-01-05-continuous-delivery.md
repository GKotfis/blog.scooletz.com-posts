I've just finished a [Continuous delivery](http://continuousdelivery.com/) book. I must say, that my expectations were much higher than the level at which the topic was described. I do not say, that this is a bad book, but having a few well-grounded articles, like [Fowler's](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) I simply do not find it good enough for a deep dive into the problem's space. The last chapters present a way in which the whole book should have been written: simple cases with a short explanation dealing with the most common problems. From the other side, the very first chapters repeat like some kind of mantra the same sentences paraphrised over and over again (*automate your build*, *do nothing manually*, etc.).

If you're a noob, and read nothing about this topic, that's a very good choice. For the others: it is not a must-have.
