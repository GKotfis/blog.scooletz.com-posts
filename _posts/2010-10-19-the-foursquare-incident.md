A nice case study about 'how to kill your app?' was published under [High Scalablity](http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/10/15/troubles-with-sharding-what-can-we-learn-from-the-foursquare.html "http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/10/15/troubles-with-sharding-what-can-we-learn-from-the-foursquare.html"). I strongly recommend this reading. Not only for NoSQL fans ;-)
